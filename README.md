# Degen Affirmations Frame
Welcome to the Degen Affirmations Frame, where every interaction is a surprise. This Farcaster frame allows users to fire off a randomized affirmation or enjoy a humorous suprise for a small DEGEN token fee. Whether you need a motivational boost or a good laugh, the Degen Affirmations Frame has something for everyone.

# Project Overview
The Degen Affirmations Frame blends the thrill of chance with the engaging experience of receiving personalized messages. It’s designed to enhance daily interactions within the Aaron community on Farcaster by offering a unique blend of entertainment and personal upliftment.

# Features
Token-Based Interaction: Uses DEGEN tokens to activate the frame.
Dynamic Affirmation Crafting: Crafts affirmations based on "vibes" sensed during the interaction.
Surprise Element: Each pull might return a motivational affirmation or a playful Rick Roll.
Shareability: Includes a 'Share' button to showcase your result as a frame on your Farcaster timeline.

# How It Works
